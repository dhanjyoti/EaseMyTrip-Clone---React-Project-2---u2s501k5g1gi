        content={
          "There is no law that allows hotel authorities to prohibit local couples from spending time with each other in a hotel room. Earlier hoteliers used to deny the local couples as they wanted to give preference to the guests who traveled from far as they usually occupy the room for more days but local couples hardly book a room for one day. However, due to the growing number of startups in the hotel industry, local couples can also book hotel rooms."

          "Early check-ins or late checkouts in hotels are subject to availability and customers have to ask about this directly from the hotels. If a hotel reception is accommodating, they can provide their guests with both Early Check-in and Late Check-out or at least one of these. However, it also depends if rooms are available in the hotel or not. Usually, guests can enjoy free early check-in or late check-out of up to 2 hours."

Booking hotels at hill stations during the rainy season can also be an opportunity to get rooms at cheaper rates."
